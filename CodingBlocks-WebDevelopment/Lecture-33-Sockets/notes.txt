Sockets and Chatting app:-

Used mainly for real time chatting.
When I message someone, the traditional client - server - client response might not be the best approach. (check why)
For this we use sockets.
Socket is a layer for communication.
It is required both for client and server.
On client it is required using script.

We need to seek server's permission to come out of server-client communication.

Emit - For client/server to send message to server/client.

Broadcast - For sending message to multiple sockets (I think only server can do this.)
For this, on server, we do io.emit, instead of socket.emit
