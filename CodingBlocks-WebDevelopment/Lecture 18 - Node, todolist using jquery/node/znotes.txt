- Node offers a place to run the console(browser waala) outside of the browser.
- It offers file handling, unlike the browser.
- It is a framework, and there are some rules to write code on it.

- We can get others' code from npm and yarn.(package manager)
- This open community of npm and yarn is based on github.
- But to search is difficult.
- Thus, we download npm, and use that to use other's code.
