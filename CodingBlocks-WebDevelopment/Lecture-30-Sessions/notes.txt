Cookies
We don't directly use cookies, coz anybody can access it and change it in the browser.
Hence to prevent this, we use express sessions.
Basically sessions helps us store cookies related data directly on the server.
And to check which user is it, server sends a session ID that gets stored in the cookies.
When we ping the server, request takes cookies with it, and the server with the sessionID retrieves from within its
own mapping the data of that particular user.

But the map is stored on our RAM.

Can be stored on mongoDB using connect-mongodb-store (npm i)
