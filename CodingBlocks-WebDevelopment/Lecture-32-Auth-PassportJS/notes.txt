Authentication using PassportJS

Static part of website is whatever is there in the public folder, html, css, JS

But beyond that, authentication would be required.

There are multiple strategies in PassportJS through which we can login
i.e., through Username/password, FB, twitter, Google, etc.

Inside package of passport itself we define the strategies.
There are 538 strategies provided by PassportJS.

But we will be mostly be using 3-4, like local, google, FB, Apple, etc.

To install say local, npm install passport-local.

NOTE****
In the login/signup form (for local login), name should always be 'username' and 'password'.
<input id='username' name='username' placeholder="Username"></input>
<input id='password' name='password' placeholder="Password"></input>

And we use bcrypt to encrypt decrypt password.
