// Notes
// For passing data from parent to child, props is used.
// For passing date from child to parent, or say, re-rendering something in parent based on action inside child.
// For this, we can use useState.
// We can pass setState to child, which when called will update todos.
// But as a good coding practice, we never pass it directly, and instead encapsulate it and then pass it inside a function.


// Read about props, {} while passing as props, using id.

Stateless vs Statefull
Components in which useState has been used - Statefull
In which not been used - Stateless

Controlled vs Uncontrolled components:-
Controlled - controlled by parents
Uncontrolled - Not Controlled '' '' ''.

When we put html elements inside React components, they are passed inside props.children to the component between whose
opening and closing brackets they were passed.

To prevent extra div, we used wrapper, in-built(React.Fragment or  simply<>) or our own.

2nd hook - useRef
Used to create a reference to an element on the DOM.
Any changes made to the ref will be immediately re-rendered.

Normal css import will apply to all components rendered in root on index.html
TO prevent, rename to todolist.module.css
And while importing, 
        import styles from './todolist.module.css'
