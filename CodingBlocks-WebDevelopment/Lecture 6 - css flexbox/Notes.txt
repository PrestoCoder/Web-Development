-Flexbox-To arrange items on our webpage hassle free.
-Used for 1 dimensional layouting.
-We can't give inline elements height, width and margin.
-For applying these properties with inline behaviour, we use inline-block.
-The container's whose elements I want to be flexbox, needs to be given display flexbox;
-By default, elements keep getting added along main axis in flexbox.
-To keep adding, it'll compress the child elements, and even flow outside the parent itself.
-If we give flex-wrap:wrap to flex container, the overflowing elements will move down.
Note***
-Any element given constant width (in px, cm, not in %) will remain of that width even when window size is decreased.
-If this happens, when viewport width is reduced, container's width will not reduce, and hence wrapping won't occur.
-Thus, to make wrapping happen responsively, container's width needs to be set in terms of vw or %.
--Justify-content:- Aligns items along the main axis.
--Align-content - Disregards height of the container, and moves items to center(y) or end, disregarding the remaining space.
--Align-items - Analogue of Justify-content for cross axis(y).

-Padding can increase width and height. To avoid that, use box-sizing:border box.
-Don't use background-image with flex, as it disregards it while deciding the size of any child element in the flex container.
Blah blah
