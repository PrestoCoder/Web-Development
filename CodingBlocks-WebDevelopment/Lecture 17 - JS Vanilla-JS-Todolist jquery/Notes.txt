jQuery is made for DOM manipulation and requests.

Jquery is to JS what STL is to C++.
Thus, it provides built in functions.
Therefore it is a JS library.

We need to download Jquery.
Can downlaod compressed or uncompressed, the former removing spaces and other unnecessary formatting.

Now we'll do all that we did to manipulate DOM.
CRUD operations, Add parent, child, next sibling, previous sibling,
classes add/remove
attributes add/remove
events - click, hover, dblclick.

But using jQuery.
---------------------

For using jQuery, we need to first wrap the element inside jQuery, and then call the jQuery function.
jQuery(element).add()

And $ is synonymous with jQuery.
Thus,
    the above is same as $(element).add
