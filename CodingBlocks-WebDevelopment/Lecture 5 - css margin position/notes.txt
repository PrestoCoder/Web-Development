css box model:-
-Margin:- margin auto doesn't work for inline elements
-Vertical margins collapse.

- float property takes elements out of the parent.
- Usually used to place elements next to each other.
- If both elements taken out, parent collapses.
- Also, in our example, p goes below img
- This is because p retains its width of 100%
- If we reduce its width, it'll go beside the image.

- If we only took image outside parent using float, 
the text would've wrapped around it.

- If we put another element in parent and make it clear, 
it makes parent assume that its children are still inside it, hence it doesn't collapse.
If there are 2 elements that are floating, clear both.
If floating on the right only, clear left, otherwise clear right.

- Instead of the above, we can clear using the pseudo element
::after method. It kind of does the same thing as above,
only it saves us from declaring a less useful div.
